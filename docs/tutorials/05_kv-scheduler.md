# KV Scheduler

---

Link to code: [Using the KV Scheduler in your plugin][code-link]

This tutorial will explain how to use the ['KV Scheduler' (KVS)][5] in our hello world plugin that was created in the
[previous tutorials](../tutorials/01_hello-world.md). You will learn how to prepare
a descriptor, generate the adapter and "wire upp" the plugin with the KVS.

Requirements:

* Complete the ['Hello World Agent'](../tutorials/01_hello-world.md) tutorial
* Complete the ['Plugin Dependencies'](../tutorials/02_plugin-deps.md) tutorial

For simplicity sake, this tutorial does not use etcd or any other northbound (NB) KV data store. Instead, NB events are created programmatically using the KV Scheduler API.

The vpp-agent is the control plane component employed to add and/or modify one or more configuration items in the VPP data plane. In practice, these actions can be dependent on each other. For example, an IP address can be assigned to an interface only if
the interface is already present in VPP.

Another example is an L2 FIB entry, which can be added only if both conditions are met:

* required interface and a bridge domain exist
* the interface is assigned to the bridge domain

This can result in the creation of a complex dependency tree.
 
Additional items to consider:

- Typically, more than one binary API call is required to configure a proto-modelled data item coming from the
   northbound
- A configuration parameter can be programmed only if its parent exists
- Configuration dependencies exist in many cases and must be handled properly

This means that VPP binary API calls must be called in a certain order. The job of the KV Scheduler is to manage configuration dependencies to ensure the correct order of API calls is executed.
 
First, we define a simple northbound [proto model][1] that we will use in our example plugin. The model defines two simple messages:
 
 - `Interface` 
 - `Route` that depends on an interface. The model demonstrates a simple
dependency between two configuration items.
 
!!! danger "Important" 
    The vpp-agent uses the Orchestrator component. It is responsible for collecting northbound
    data from multiple sources (mainly a KV data store and GRPC clients). To marshall/unmarshall proto messages defined in northbound proto models, the Orchestrator requires message names to be present in the messages. 

To generate code where message names are present in proto messages, we use the following special protobuf option together with its import:
```proto
import "github.com/gogo/protobuf/gogoproto/gogo.proto";
option (gogoproto.messagename_all) = true;
```

In order to register our Hello World plugin with the scheduler and to work with our new model, we need two new 
components - a **descriptor** and, an **adapter** for every proto-defined type (proto message).
 
#### 1. Adapters
 
Let's start with adapters. An adapter defines conversion methods between our proto-defined type and
a bare `proto.Message` that the KV Scheduler works with. Since this is a boilerplate code, there is a tooling to auto-generate
adaptors. The code generator is called `descriptor-adapter` and it can be found [inside the KVScheduler plugin][2]. You can install it manually as follows:

```bash
go install github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/plugins/kvscheduler/descriptor-adapter
```

Alternatively, you can put the following target into your project Makefile (assuming you have a dependency on the vpp-agent in your vendor directory):

```
get-generators:
    @go install ./vendor/github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/plugins/kvscheduler/descriptor-adapter
```

Build the binary file from the `.go` files inside, and use it to generate the adapters for the `Interface` and `Route` proto messages:
 
```
descriptor-adapter --descriptor-name Interface --value-type *model.Interface --import "github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/examples/tutorials/05_kv-scheduler/model" --output-dir "descriptor"
descriptor-adapter --descriptor-name Route --value-type *model.Route --import "github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/examples/tutorials/05_kv-scheduler/model" --output-dir "descriptor"
```

It is good practice to add the above commands to the plugin's `main.go` file with the `//go:generate` directives. The
`descriptor-adapter` generator will put the generated adapters into the `descriptor/adapter` directory within the
plugin folder.

#### 2. Descriptor without Dependency

The next  step is to define descriptors. We start with the interface descriptor that has no dependencies.

A descriptor can be implemented in one of two ways:

- Define the descriptor constructor that directly implements all required methods. This works well when the implementation uses a relatively small number of short descriptor methods.
- Define a descriptor object that implements all required methods on this object. This places method references in the descriptor constructor. This is the preferred technique.

In the interface descriptor, we use the first approach. Let's create a new file called `descriptors.go` so that the descriptor code is outside of `main.go`.

Next, add the following code:

```go
func NewIfDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.InterfaceDescriptor{
		// descriptor implementation
	}
	return adapter.NewInterfaceDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```


`NewIfDescriptor` is a constructor function that returns a type-safe descriptor object. All potential descriptor 
dependencies (logger, various mappings, etc.) are provided via constructor parameters.  

If you examine `adapter.InterfaceDescriptor`, you will see several fields defined. The most important are function-types with CRUD definitions and the fields resolving dependencies. The full API list is documented in the [KV Descriptor structure][3].

Here, we implement the the APIs that we need for our simple example:

* Name that must be unique for all descriptors.
```go
    Name: "if-descriptor",
```

* Northbound key prefix for the configuration type handled by the descriptor.
```go
NBKeyPrefix: "/interface/",
```

* String representation of the type.
```go
ValueTypeName: proto.MessageName(&model.Interface{}),
```

* Configuration item identifier (label, name, index) is returned by this method. 
```go
KeyLabel: func(key string) string {
    return strings.TrimPrefix(key, "/interface/")
},
```

* Key selector returns `true` if the provided key is described by the given descriptor. A descriptor can support a
  subset of keys, but it can only process one value type.
```go
KeySelector: func(key string) bool {
    if strings.HasPrefix(key, ifPrefix) {
        return true
    }
    return false
},
```

* This flag enables metadata for the given type.
```go
WithMetadata: true,
```

* Create method configures a new configuration item (interface).
```go
Create: func(key string, value *model.Interface) (metadata interface{}, err error) {
    d.log.Infof("Interface %s created", value.Name)
    return value.Name, nil
},
```

This is how the completed interface descriptor will look:
```go
func NewIfDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.InterfaceDescriptor{
		Name: ifDescriptorName,
		NBKeyPrefix: ifPrefix,
		ValueTypeName: proto.MessageName(&model.Interface{}),
		KeyLabel: func(key string) string {
			return strings.TrimPrefix(key, ifPrefix)
		},
		KeySelector: func(key string) bool {
			if strings.HasPrefix(key, ifPrefix) {
				return true
			}
			return false
		},
		WithMetadata: true,
		Create: func(key string, value *model.Interface) (metadata interface{}, err error) {
			logger.Infof("Interface %s created", value.Name)
			return value.Name, nil
		},
	}
	return adapter.NewInterfaceDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```

#### 3. Descriptor with Dependency

Next, we continue with the route descriptor that has a dependency on an interface. This descriptor defines additional
fields since we will need to define the dependency on the interface configuration item. We will also specify the descriptor struct and implement methods outside of the descriptor constructor.

First, define the struct and constructor:

```go
type RouteDescriptor struct {
	// dependencies
	log logging.PluginLogger
}

func NewRouteDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.RouteDescriptor{
		// descriptor implementation
	}
	return adapter.NewRouteDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```


In this case, the descriptor fields are defined as methods of `RouteDescriptor` using their respective function signatures:
```go
func (d *RouteDescriptor) KeyLabel(key string) string {
	return strings.TrimPrefix(key, routePrefix)
}

func (d *RouteDescriptor) KeySelector(key string) bool {
	if strings.HasPrefix(key, routePrefix) {
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func (d *RouteDescriptor) Dependencies(key string, value *model.Route) []api.Dependency {
	return []api.Dependency{
		{
			Label: routeInterfaceDepLabel,
			Key:   ifPrefix + value.InterfaceName,
		},
	}
}
```

The field `WithMetadata` is not needed here so the `Create` method will not return any metadata.

```go
func (d *RouteDescriptor) Create(key string, value *model.Route) (metadata interface{}, err error) {
	d.log.Infof("Created route %s dependent on interface %s", value.Name, value.InterfaceName)
	return nil, nil
}
``` 

In addition, there are two new fields:

* Dependencies list with a key prefix and a unique label value are required for any given configuration item. The item will not be created because the dependendcy key does not exist. The label is informative and should be unique.
```go
func (d *RouteDescriptor) Dependencies(key string, value *model.Route) []api.Dependency {
	return []api.Dependency{
		{
			Label: routeInterfaceDepLabel,
			Key:   ifPrefix + value.InterfaceName,
		},
	}
}
```

* Descriptors list where the dependent values are processed. 

In the example, we return the interface descriptor
  since this is the one handling interfaces.
```go
RetrieveDependencies: []string{ifDescriptorName},
```

Now define descriptor context of type `RouteDescriptor` within `NewRouteDescriptor`:
```go
func NewRouteDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	descriptorCtx := &RouteDescriptor{
		log: logger,
	}
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.RouteDescriptor{
		// descriptor implementation
	}
	return adapter.NewRouteDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```

Set non-function fields:
```go
func NewRouteDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	descriptorCtx := &RouteDescriptor{
		log: logger,
	}
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.RouteDescriptor{
        Name: routeDescriptorName,
        NBKeyPrefix: routePrefix,
        ValueTypeName: proto.MessageName(&model.Route{}),      
        RetrieveDependencies: []string{ifDescriptorName},
	}
	return adapter.NewRouteDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```

Set function fields as references to the `RouteDescriptor` methods. Here is the complete descriptor:
```go
func NewRouteDescriptor(logger logging.PluginLogger) *api.KVDescriptor {
	descriptorCtx := &RouteDescriptor{
		log: logger,
	}
	typedDescriptor := &adapter.RouteDescriptor{
		Name: routeDescriptorName,
		NBKeyPrefix: routePrefix,
		ValueTypeName: proto.MessageName(&model.Route{}),
		KeyLabel: descriptorCtx.KeyLabel,
		KeySelector: descriptorCtx.KeySelector,
		Dependencies: descriptorCtx.Dependencies,
		Create: descriptorCtx.Create,
	}
	return adapter.NewRouteDescriptor(typedDescriptor)
}
```

The descriptor API provides additional methods such as Update(), Delete(), Retrieve() and Validate().

 The full list can be found in the [KV Descriptor API documentation.][3]

#### Wire Our Plugin with the KV Scheduler

Now with thee descriptors completed, we can register them in the `main.go` file. The first step is to add the `KVScheduler` to the
`HelloWorld` plugin as a plugin dependency:
```go
type HelloWorld struct {
	infra.PluginDeps
	KVScheduler api.KVScheduler
}
```

Next, register the descriptors with the KV Scheduler in the hello world plugin `Init()`:
```go
func (p *HelloWorld) Init() error {
	p.Log.Println("Hello World!")

	err := p.KVScheduler.RegisterKVDescriptor(adapter.NewInterfaceDescriptor(NewIfDescriptor(p.Log).GetDescriptor()))
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}

	err = p.KVScheduler.RegisterKVDescriptor(adapter.NewRouteDescriptor(NewRouteDescriptor(p.Log).GetDescriptor()))
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}

	return nil
}
```

The last step is to replace the plugin initialization method with `AllPlugins()` in the `main()` to ensure that the 
KV Scheduler is loaded and initialized from the hello world plugin.
```go
a := agent.NewAgent(agent.AllPlugins(p))
```

Starting the agent will load the KV Scheduler plugin together with the hello world plugin. The KV Scheduler will
receive all northbound data and pass it to the hello world descriptor in correct order. If dependencies for a 
configuration item are not met (i.e. if a route is programmed before its interface dependency is met), the item 
will be cached.

#### Example and testing

The example code from this tutorial can be found [here][4]. It contains `main.go`, `descriptors.go` and two folders with
model and generated adapters. The tutorial example is extended for the `AfterInit()` method which starts a new go routine
with a testing procedure.

The example below performs three test cases and can be built and started without any config files. Northbound transactions are simulated with the KV Scheduler method `StartNBTransaction()`.

* **1. Configure the interface and the route in a single transaction**

This is the part of the output labelled as `planned operations`:
```bash
1. CREATE:
  - key: /interface/if1
  - value: { name:"if1"  } 
2. CREATE:
  - key: /route/route1
  - value: { name:"route1" interface_name:"if1"  } 
``` 

As expected, the interface is created first and the route second, following the order values were set to the transaction.

* **2. Configure the route and the interface in a single transaction.** This order is reversed from the test case above.

Output:
```bash
1. CREATE:
  - key: /interface/if2
  - value: { name:"if2"  } 
2. CREATE:
  - key: /route/route2
  - value: { name:"route2" interface_name:"if2"  } 
```

The order is exactly the same despite the fact values were added to transaction in the reverse order. As shown, the scheduler ordered configuration items in the correct sequence before creating the transaction.

* **3. Configure the route and the interface in separated transactions**

In this case, we have two outputs since there are two transactions:

```bash
1. CREATE [NOOP IS-PENDING]:
  - key: /route/route3
  - value: { name:"route3" interface_name:"if3"  } 
```

The route comes first, but it is postponed (cached) since the dependent interface does not exist and the scheduler does not know when it will appear. The route is marked as `[NOOP IS-PENDING]`.

```bash
1. CREATE:
  - key: /interface/if3
  - value: { name:"if3"  } 
2. CREATE [WAS-PENDING]:
  - key: /route/route3
  - value: { name:"route3" interface_name:"if3"  } 
```

The second transaction introduces the expected interface. The scheduler:
 
- recognized this as a dependency for the cached route
- sorted items into the correct order
- called the appropriate configuration method. 

The previously cached route is marked as `[WAS-PENDING]`, highlighting that this item was postponed.
