# DB plugins

## Datasync plugin

Package datasync defines the interfaces for the abstraction of a data synchronization between app plugins and different backend data sources (such as data stores, message buses, or RPC-connected clients).

In this context, data synchronization is about multiple data sets that need to be synchronized whenever a particular event is published. The event can be published by:

- database (when particular data was changed); 
- by message bus (such as consuming messages from Kafka topics); 
- or by RPC clients (when GRPC or REST service call ).

The data synchronization APIs are centered around watching and publishing data change events. These events are processed asynchronously.

The data handled by one plugin can have references to the data of another plugin. Therefore, a proper time/order of data resynchronization between plugins needs to be maintained. The datasync plugin initiates a full data resync in the same order as the other plugins have been registered in Init().
  
### Watch data API

Watch data API is used by app plugin to:
1. Subscribe channels for data changes using `Watch()`, while being abstracted from a particular message source (data store, message bus or RPC)
2. Process full Data RESYNC (startup & fault recovery scenarios). Feedback is given back to the user of this API (e.g. successful configuration or an error) via callback.
3. Process Incremental Data CHANGE. This is an optimized variant of RESYNC, where only the minimal set of changes (deltas) needed to get in-sync gets propagated to plugins. Again, feedback to the user of the API (e.g. successful configuration or an error) is returned via callback.

![datasync][datasync-image]

This APIs define two types of events that a plugin must be able to process:

1. Full Data RESYNC (resynchronization) event is defined to trigger resynchronization of the whole configuration. This event is used after agent start/restart, or for a fault recovery scenario (e.g. when agent's connectivity to an external data source is lost and restored).
2. Incremental Data CHANGE event is defined to trigger incremental processing of configuration changes. Each data change event contains both the previous and the new/current value. The Data synchronization is switched to this optimized mode only after successful Full Data RESYNC.

### Publish data API

Publish data API is used by app plugins to asynchronously publish events with particular data change values and still remain abstracted from the target data store, message bus, local/RPC client.

## Data Broker 

The CN-Infra Data Broker abstraction (see the diagram below) is based on two APIs: 

* **The Broker API** - used by app plugins to PULL (i.e. retrieve) data from a data store or PUSH (i.e. write) data into the data store. Data  can be retrieved for a specific key or by running a query. Data can be written for a specific key. Multiple writes can be executed in a transaction.
* **The Watcher API** - used by app plugins to WATCH data on a specified key. Watching means to monitor for data changes and be notified as soon as a change occurs.
  
![db][db-image]

The Broker & Watcher APIs abstract common database operations implemented by different databases (etcd, Redis, Cassandra). Still, there are major differences between key-value-based & sql-based databases. Therefore the Broker & Watcher Go interfaces are defined in each package separately; while the method names for a given operation 
are the same, the method arguments are different.

### Key-value data store

The `keyval` package defines the client API to access a key-value data store. It comprises two sub-APIs: the `Broker` interface supports reading and manipulation of key-value pairs; the `Watcher` API provides functions for monitoring of changes in a data store. Both interfaces are available with arguments of type `[]bytes` (raw data) and `proto.Message` (protobuf formatted data).

The `keyval` package also provides a skeleton for a key-value plugin. A particular data store is selected in the `NewSkeleton` constructor using an argument of type `CoreBrokerWatcher`. The skeleton handles the plugin's life-cycle and provides unified access to datastore implementing the `KvPlugin` interface.

## etcd plugin

The etcd plugin provides access to an etcd key-value data store.

### Configuration

- Location of the etcd configuration file can be defined either by the command line flag `etcd-config` or set via the `etcd_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Status Check

- If injected, etcd plugin will use StatusCheck plugin to periodically issue a minimalistic GET request to check for the status of the connection. The etcd connection state affects the global status of the agent. If agent cannot establish connection with etcd, both the readiness and the liveness probe from the probe plugin will return a negative 
result (accessible only via REST API in such case).

### Compacting

You can compact etcd using two ways.

- using API by calling `plugin.Compact()` which will compact the database to the current revision.
- using config file by setting `auto-compact` option to the duration of period that you want the etcd to be compacted.

### Reconnect resynchronization

- If connection to the etcd is interrupted, resync can be automatically called after re-connection. This option is disabled by default and has to be allowed in the `etcd.conf` file.
  
Set `resync-after-reconnect` to `true` to enable the feature.
  
Redis is the implementation of the key-value Data Broker client API for the Redis key-value data store. The entity `BytesConnectionRedis` provides access to CRUD as well as event subscription API's.
```
   +-----+   (Broker)   +------------------------+ -->  CRUD      +-------+ -->
   | app |                   |  BytesConnectionRedis  |                 | Redis |
   +-----+    <-- (KeyValProtoWatcher)  +------------------------+  <--  events    +-------+
```

## Redis

The code snippets below provide examples to help you get started. For simplicity, error handling is omitted.

### Need to import following dependencies

```
import "github.com/ligato/cn-infra/db/keyval/kvproto"
import "github.com/ligato/cn-infra/db/keyval/redis"
import "github.com/ligato/cn-infra/utils/config"
import "github.com/ligato/cn-infra/logging/logrus"
```

### Define client configuration based on your Redis installation.

- Single Node
var cfg redis.NodeConfig
- Sentinel Enabled Cluster
var cfg redis.SentinelConfig
- Redis Cluster
var cfg redis.ClusterConfig

You can initialize any of the above configuration instances in memory, or load the settings from file using 
```
err = config.ParseConfigFromYamlFile(configFile, &cfg)
```
You can also load any of the three configuration files using
```
var cfg interface{}
cfg, err := redis.LoadConfig(configFile)
```

### Create connection from configuration

```
client, err := redis.CreateClient(cfg)
db, err := redis.NewBytesConnection(client, logrus.DefaultLogger())
```

### Create Brokers / Watchers from connection

```
//create broker/watcher that share the same connection pools.
bytesBroker := db.NewBroker("some-prefix")
bytesWatcher := db.NewWatcher("some-prefix")

// create broker/watcher that share the same connection pools,
// capable of processing protocol-buffer generated data.
wrapper := kvproto.NewProtoWrapper(db)
protoBroker := wrapper.NewBroker("some-prefix")
protoWatcher := wrapper.NewWatcher("some-prefix")
```

### Perform CRUD operations

```
// put
err = db.Put("some-key", []byte("some-value"))
err = db.Put("some-temp-key", []byte("valid for 20 seconds"),
             datasync.WithTTL(20*time.Second))

// get
value, found, revision, err := db.GetValue("some-key")
if found {
   ...
}

// Note: flight.Info implements proto.Message.
f := flight.Info{
       Airline:  "UA",
       Number:   1573,
       Priority: 1,
    }
err = protoBroker.Put("some-key-prefix", &f)
f2 := flight.Info{}
found, revision, err = protoBroker.GetValue("some-key-prefix", &f2)

// list
keyPrefix := "some"
kv, err := db.ListValues(keyPrefix)
for {
   kv, done := kv.GetNext()
   if done {
       break
   }
    key := kv.GetKey()
   value := kv.GetValue()
}

// delete
found, err := db.Delete("some-key")
// or, delete all keys matching the prefix "some-key".
found, err := db.Delete("some-key", datasync.WithPrefix())

// transaction
var txn keyval.BytesTxn = db.NewTxn()
txn.Put("key101", []byte("val 101")).Put("key102", []byte("val 102"))
txn.Put("key103", []byte("val 103")).Put("key104", []byte("val 104"))
err := txn.Commit()
```

### Subscribe to key space events

```
watchChan := make(chan keyval.BytesWatchResp, 10)
err = db.Watch(watchChan, "some-key")
for {
   select {
    case r := <-watchChan:
       switch r.GetChangeType() {
       case datasync.Put:
           log.Infof("KeyValProtoWatcher received %v: %s=%s", r.GetChangeType(),
                     r.GetKey(), string(r.GetValue()))
       case datasync.Delete:
           ...
       }
   ...
   }
}
```
!!! note
    You must configure Redis for it to publish key space events.
```
config SET notify-keyspace-events KA
```

### Resiliency

Connection/read/write time-outs, failover, reconnection and recovery are validated by running the airport example against a Redis Sentinel Cluster. Redis nodes are paused selectively to simulate server down:
```
$ docker-compose ps
```
|Name   |Command  |State|Ports|
|-------|---------|-----|-----|
|dockerredissentinel_master_1 | docker-entrypoint.sh redis ... | Paused | 6379/tcp |
|dockerredissentinel_slave_1 | docker-entrypoint.sh redis ... | Up | 6379/tcp |
|dockerredissentinel_slave_2 | docker-entrypoint.sh redis ... | Up | 6379/tcp |
|dockerredissentinel_sentinel_1 | sentinel-entrypoint.sh | Up | 26379/tcp, 6379/tcp |
|dockerredissentinel_sentinel_2 | sentinel-entrypoint.sh | Up | 26379/tcp, 6379/tcp |
|dockerredissentinel_sentinel_3 | sentinel-entrypoint.sh | Up | 26379/tcp, 6379/tcp |

## Consul plugin

The Consul plugin provides access to a consul key-value data store.

### Configuration

- Location of the Consul configuration file can be defined either by the command line flag `consul-config` or set via the `CONSUL_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Status Check

- If injected, Consul plugin will use StatusCheck plugin to periodically issue a minimalistic GET request to check for the status of the connection. The consul connection state affects the global status of the agent. If agent cannot establish connection with consul, both the readiness and the liveness probe from the probe plugin will return a negative result (accessible only via REST API in such case).

### Reconnect resynchronization

- If connection to the Consul is interrupted, resync can be automatically called after re-connection. This option is disabled by default and has to be allowed in the etcd.conf file. Set `resync-after-reconnect` to `true` to enable the feature.

## FileDB

The fileDB plugin allows to use the file system of a operating system as a key-value data store. The filesystem plugin watches for pre-defined files or directories, reads a configuration and sends response events according to changes.

All the configuration is resynced in the beginning (as for standard key-value data store). Configuration files then can be added, updated, moved, renamed or removed, plugin makes all the necessary changes.

!!! danger "Important"
    FileDB as datastore is read-only from the plugin perspective, changes from within the plugin are not allowed.

### Configuration

All files/directories used as a data store must be defined in configuration file. Location of the file can be defined either by the command line flag `filedb-config` or set via the `FILEDB_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Supported formats

* JSON `(*.json)`
* YAML `(*.yaml)`

### Data structure

Plugin currently supports only JSON and YAML-formatted data. The format of the file is as follows for JSON:

```
{
    "data": [
        {
            "key": "<key>",
            "value": {
                <proto-modelled data>
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "<key>",
            "value": {
                <proto-modelled data>
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}

``` 

For YAML:

```

---
data:
    -
        key: '<key>'
        value: '<modelled data>'

```

Key has to contain also instance prefix with micro service label, so plugin knows which parts of the configuration are intended for it. All configuration is stored internally in local database. It allows to compare events and respond with correct 'previous' value for a given key. 

### Data state propagation

Data types supporting status propagation (like interfaces or bridge domains) can store the state in filesystem. There is a field in configuration file called `status-path` which has to be set in order to store the status. Status data will be stored in the same format as for configuration, type is defined by the file extension (JSON or YAML).

Data will not be propagated if target path directory.
