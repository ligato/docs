# Frequently Asked Questions

---

## General

### What is the vpp-agent?

A [control plane agent for a VPP data plane](framework.md#vpp-agent) that resides inside a single container. It comes with various plugins (e.g. ACL) for programming specific data plane functions. It is an entity completely separate from VPP. Customized or out-of-the-box VPP-based containerized VNFs can incorporate the vpp-agent.

### What is cn-infra?

[Framework of libraries and plugins](framework.md#infra) for building control plane agents for CNFs and applications.


### Is Ligato an application?

No. Select Ligato components (i.e. vpp-agent, prometheus plugin, etcd connectors, etc.) are used as building blocks for CNF and/or cloud-native application implementations.


### How are the vpp-agent and cn-infra related?

They compliment each other. Both provide plugins for developers to use in implementing CNFs. For example, a VPP-based CNF will use vpp-agent plugins for data plane programmability and cn-infra plugins (e.g. etcd connector, REST, gRPC, etc.) for communications with external applications.

### What is a CNF?

[Cloud Native Network Function](https://ligato.io/cnf/cnf-def/). Containerized network functions (e.g. IPsec) subscribing to cloud-native architectural and operational principles (e.g. Kubernetes lifecycle).

### What is VPP?

[Vector Packet Processing](https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/What_is_VPP%3F) is a software platform for forwarding packets. [FD.io](https://fd.io/) is the open source project for VPP.

### Is VPP part of Ligato?

No. Ligato includes the vpp-agent along with other plugins providing overall management, control and lifecycle support for VPP-based CNFs and cloud-native applications.

### Can Ligato be used to build non-VPP cloud-native apps?

Yes. One example is an [experimental BGP agent](https://github.com/ligato/bgp-agent) that does not use VPP.


### Is Ligato a CNCF project?

No. However it is a member of the [larger CNCF ecosystem](https://landscape.cncf.io/). Many of its plugins are based on CNCF projects (e.g. gRPC, etcd, prometheus).

### Are their solutions using Ligato?

Yes. [Contiv-VPP](https://contivpp.io/) and [Network Service Mesh (NSM)](https://networkservicemesh.io/) use Ligato components.

## Details

### What is a plugin?

Small chunk of code performing a specific function. Ligato (vpp-agent and cn-infra) come with multiple out-of-the-box [plugins](../plugins/plugin-overview.md). New plugins can be developed performing additional functions. Developers need only use the plugins required for their application.

### How does a Ligato-built CNF talk to external apps?

Ligato provides plugins, and developers can craft their own for communicating with external applications.

### What is a Key Value (KV) Data Store?

Data store (or database) of key-value (KV) pairs. Ligato supports the [commonly used/deployed KV data store solutions](../user-guide/concepts.md#key-value-data-store-overview). Plugins can be created to interface to other external KV data stores.

### What programming language does Ligato use?

[Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) developed by Google. Other cloud-native projects including Kubernetes and etcd use Go. Advantages over other languages (i.e. python, java) used in distributed systems include speed (it is a compiled language), concurrency and simplicity. External applications interfacing to a Ligato application can use any programming language.

### What is protobufs?

[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) is a language/platform-nuetral method that defines the structure and serialized format of the data associated with the object. [Here](https://github.com/ligato/vpp-agent/blob/master/proto/ligato/vpp/l3/route.proto) is an example of a VPP route in protobuf (.proto) format.

### What is a resync?

A vpp-agent process that maintains consistency between configuration data provided from an external source, internal vpp-agent state and the actual VPP data plane state.

### What is a model?

Each object is defined by a model consisting of a [module, version and type fields](../user-guide/concepts.md).

### What is the microservice label?

A unique value assigned to a group of vpp-agents watching the KV data store for config changes with a common key prefix. This is useful if you have CNFs with different config data contained in a KV data store. More details and an example are shown [here](../user-guide/concepts.md#why-the-kv-data-store).

### What does northbound (NB) mean? Same for southbound (SB)?
NB means configuration data originates from an external source such as a KV data store. SB means configuration data present in the VPP data plane.

## Using Ligato

### How do I get started?

Start with the [Quickstart Guide](../user-guide/quickstart.md) to quickly build and program a VPP-based CNF.

### Are there any tutorials I could follow?

Yes. See [tutorials](../tutorials/00_tutorial-setup.md) beginning with coding up a "Hello World" plugin.

### Are there any example apps I could look at?

Yes. See the [examples](../user-guide/examples.md) section

### Is there a CLI?

Yes. [AgentCtl](../user-guide/agentctl.md) supplies the developer or operator with numerous CLI commands for working with Ligato.

### Can I use other CLIs?

Absolutely. Kubernetes [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) and Contiv-VPP [contiv-netctl](https://contivpp.io/blog/using-conti-vpp-netctl-blog/) are examples associated with complete Kubnetes cluster environments.

etcdctl and vppctl provide CLI commands for interacting with an etcd data store and VPP respectively. The quickstart guide contains samples for [etcdctl](../user-guide/quickstart.md#32-use-the-etcd-client-etcdctl) and [vppctl](../user-guide/quickstart.md#53-connect-to-the-vpp-dataplane-in-the-container). The VPP CLI supported by agentctl, REST or by attaching to VPP is explained [here](../user-guide/vpp-cli.md).

### How do I determine what Ligato version I am working with? Same for VPP.

[AgentCtl](../user-guide/agentctl.md) provides a command to display Ligato agent and VPP version information. You can also attach to the VPP CLI and run the show version command.


### How is a Ligato-based application configured?

Ligato employs a stateless configuration approach. vpp-agents "listen" for config updates stored as key-value pairs in a KV data store. There is an example from the [quick start guide](../user-guide/quickstart.md#51-configure-the-vpp-dataplane-using-the-vpp-agent) showing config data in etcd pushed to the vpp-agent. Ligato applications can be developed using a myriad of other configuration techniques including kubectl, Helm charts, yaml files, gRPC, REST, agentctl and so on. [Here](../plugins/connection-plugins.md#vpp-agent-grpc) is an example using gRPC to convey config data to a vpp-agent.

### What is a .conf file

Contain [plugin configuration values](../user-guide/config-files.md). Most but not all plugins have their own .conf file.

---

## KVScheduler

### What is the KVScheduler (KVS)?

Provides transaction-based configuration processing employing a generic (abstraction) mechanism for dependency resolution between different configuration items. For example, the KVS sorts out and resolves dependencies where an interface must be configured first before proceeding with a bridge-domain. More details on the KVS can be found [here](../plugins/kvs-plugin.md).

### What is a Descriptor?

A construct used by the KVS that describes a particular configuration object (e.g. VPP route). Among other values, descriptors define dependencies and supported create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations. More on descriptors [here](../developer-guide/kvdescriptor.md).

### What is a KVS Transaction?

This is the series of configuration actions as determine by the KVS. There is a [KVS transaction log](../developer-guide/kvs-troubleshooting.md#understanding-the-kvscheduler-transaction-log) function illustrating the details of a transaction.


### KVS Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting KVS operations including several tools to assist can be found [here](../developer-guide/kvs-troubleshooting.md)

## APIs

### What RPCs are supported by Ligato?

gRPC and REST.

### What REST APIs are supported?

VPP REST APIs are documented [here](../plugins/../plugins/connection-plugins.md#supported-urls). There are also REST APIs for determining the [descriptors registered with the KVS](../developer-guide/kvs-troubleshooting.md#how-to-list-registered-descriptors-and-watched-key-prefixes) and for [retrieving data for visualizing the KVS graph](../developer-guide/kvs-troubleshooting.md#how-to-visualize-the-graph)

### Can I develop my own set of customized APIs?

Yes. The [REST Handler tutorial](../tutorials/03_rest-handler.md) shows you how to create a REST API for the Hello World plugin.
